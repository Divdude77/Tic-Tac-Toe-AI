Use a menu to choose your gamemode, then play! 

Options can be selected on the board by writing the row and column.
Eg:  
                       1      2      3   
                  a  '|X|', '|O|', '|X|'
                  b  '|O|', '| |', '| |'
                  c  '|X|', '| |', '|O|'
     Now, to place an X in the middle, we will type the row name (b) along with the column name(2). So, the input becomes: b2.
